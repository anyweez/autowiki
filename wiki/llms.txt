# autowiki Wiki

> Agent-maintained documentation for understanding this codebase.

## Quick Start

This wiki is designed for AI agents working with this codebase. Start with the overview page for a high-level understanding, then explore specific concepts as needed.

## Overview

- [Agent Wiki](wiki/overview.md): A Claude Code plugin that maintains an auto-updating wiki for agent context about how repository components work. The plugin enables AI agents to explore codebases, synthesize findings, and generat...

## Concepts

- [Agents](wiki/agents.md): The agent-wiki plugin uses two specialized sub-agents to explore codebases and synthesize documentation. These agents are defined as markdown instruction files that Claude Code launches as Task sub...
- [Architecture](wiki/architecture.md): The agent-wiki plugin follows a command-agent-script architecture where user commands orchestrate specialized agents that produce wiki content, supported by utility scripts for serving and indexing.

## Reference

- [Commands](wiki/commands.md): The agent-wiki plugin provides four user-invokable commands, each defined as a markdown file in `plugins/agent-wiki/commands/`. Commands are namespaced with the `agent-wiki:` prefix when installed ...
- [Configuration](wiki/configuration.md): The agent-wiki plugin uses several configuration files and data structures to control behavior, enable auto-updates, and support plugin distribution.
- [Scripts](wiki/scripts.md): The agent-wiki plugin includes two utility scripts: a Python script for generating llms.txt files and a Node.js HTTP server for browsing the wiki locally.
