# autowiki Wiki

> Agent-maintained documentation for understanding this codebase.

## Quick Start

This wiki is designed for AI agents working with this codebase. Start with the overview page for a high-level understanding, then explore specific concepts as needed.

## Overview

- [autowiki](wiki/overview.md): Auto-generated wiki documentation for your codebase, built by AI agents and browsable by humans. The project has two parts: a **Claude Code plugin** that builds and maintains a wiki, and an **npm p...

## Concepts

- [Agents](wiki/agents.md): The autowiki plugin uses two specialized sub-agents to explore codebases and synthesize documentation. These agents are defined as markdown instruction files that Claude Code launches as Task sub-a...

## Reference

- [Commands](wiki/commands.md): The autowiki plugin provides three user-invokable commands, each defined as a markdown file in `plugins/autowiki/commands/`. Commands are namespaced with the `autowiki:` prefix when installed as a ...
- [Configuration](wiki/configuration.md): The autowiki plugin uses several configuration files and data structures to control behavior, enable auto-updates, and support plugin distribution.
- [Scripts](wiki/scripts.md): autowiki includes a Node.js script for generating llms.txt files and an npm package for browsing the wiki locally. The web server has been moved out of the plugin and into the main npm package (`np...
